# physician-specialties-and-procedures
 Create a dashboard of all Medicare-reporting physicians in the US: Their specialties, hospital affiliations, and procedures performed.

#Overview
 This Project takes in Medicare reporting data, for each physician, for each procedure, how many times they performed the procedure. It will explode out that dataset to *simulate* event-level data (e.g. each procedure performed).

#Expected Output
 A dashboard that shows, for any given time/place/procedure, how many times the procedure was performed. Because each event also has metadata about the doctor (hospital affiliations, specializations), I will be able to look at which specializations are more/less likely to go together, which hospitals are more likely to share doctors, and which doctors may be traveling very far to fulfill their multiple specializations.
